# The plaptop
The meaning of plaptop is basiclly the guts of a laptop stuffed into a PC case to
+ Have better cooling
+ Make it look cool with rgb
+ Be the wierdist kid on the block

For us we tested this with the hp 15d-u4016TX.  

Btw this is an unfinished project because my friend blew up the mainboard accidentally
I think like half of the stuff I made does not work...
OR IS IT??

THANKS TO MY FRIEND WHO IS EDITING THIS README THEY HAVE DONE SOME PRO STUFF TO THE BOARD AND DEBUGGED IT.... AND WE KNOW WHATS WRONG AND ITS AN EZ FIX!!!

we will update this when its done.
